& JENNA >^..^< 

About the project:

Watts revisited examines the events leading up to the 1965 rebellion and its aftermath using visual web techniques for the upcoming 50th anniversary and explore what has changed in the community since then. 

Jenna, Sinduja: Work and roles:

Wireframe v1: Sinduja
Wireframe v2: Jenna
Autoplay video and index page: Sinduja
Homepage with parallax scroll: Jenna
Interactive menu: Jenna
Drivethrough with hotspots:
	Filming - Jenna, Sinduja
	Coding - Sinduja
Maps -  Maps by Sinduja, integration/CSS changes by Jenna
Peoplestories - Hand-coded without plugins by Jenna.

Other pages: Both of us equal effort, we don't remember who did what. They were small elements

Notes about the project:

Please wait for the virtual tour to load. If you see something funky happening, its because it hasn’t loaded properly. Refresh page and wait to load. 

Peoplestories + Before and after are not complete. We are waiting on Daniela to give us the content, so exclude those from grading. We just wanted to leave it there so we can substitute stuff later easily and you can see what we have done till now.

There should also be additional context provided for the map on the homepage, which shows incidents that occurred during the riots plotted on a map. This will be added later.
