<h1>Watts Riots Revisited</h1>

<p>On a hot summer evening in Watts, Marquette Frye, an African-American man, was pulled over by a white California Highway Patrol officer, who suspected Frye of driving under the influence of alcohol. A crowd gathered and tension between police officers and people escalated to a violent outburst. </p>

<p>For the next six days, violence and mayhem led to the loss of 34 lives, 1032 injuries, 3438 arrests, and over $40 million in property damage. The incident, called the "Watts rebellion" by many, was one of the largest urban revolutions of the civil rights era. </p>

<p>This project aims to examine the events leading up to the rebellion and its aftermath using visual web techniques for the upcoming 50th anniversary and explore what has changed in the community since then. </p>
